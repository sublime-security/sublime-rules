description: 'Detects the landing page of a Spanish-speaking phishing kit targeting
  Microsoft with two stages.


  The first stage is a landing page with a "Start the corresponding verification process"
  message, on the second stage the user is asked to enter their credentials. The stages
  switch using a redirect through an anchor.


  The detection of this tiny HTML page is based on the fact that the attacker thought
  it''s a good idea to use special characters for their asset URLs.


  Found as a result of this kit being deployed on Replit.


  Converted from IOK rule - original focuses on website analysis.'
detection_methods:
- Header analysis
- Sender analysis
