  \ LunarClient users using various lures such \nas free ranks, cosmetics or modifications.\

  \ an item from the attacker/compromised account, \nit then asks the victim to enter\
  \ their username and email, upon \ndoing this the backend will send the victim an\
  \ email asking to \nverify the gift by entering their authentication code into the\
  \ \nwebsite.\n\nThis specific kit dubbed `Hyphisher` is developed by a threat\n\
  actor named `GuteNacht` and has since been modified and forked\nby other threat\
  \ actors within the threat landscape.\n\nConverted from IOK rule - original focuses\
