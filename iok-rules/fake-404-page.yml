- Credential Phishing
description: 'A common way for phishing sites to avoid detection is by presenting
  a fake 404 error page when requested using the "wrong" User Agent (or from the wrong
  GeoIP location).


  These fake error pages exactly mimic the HTML of an Apache 404 page, but unless
  the threat actor has configured their site to hide it, there''s two giveaways it''s
  fake:

  - It sends an `X-Powered-By: PHP` header

  - It sets a `PHPSESSID` cookie


  These are both clear evidence that the 404 page has been generated by PHP and not
  by Apache.
