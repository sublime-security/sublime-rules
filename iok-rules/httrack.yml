description: 'HTTrack is an open source tool to save a website and all its dependencies
  to disk.

  It''s used by phishers to quickly clone a target website to get a pixel-perfect
  clone they can adapt into a phishing kit.


  It''s particularly liked by phishers because it tries to ensure that *all* resources
  are saved offline, and none are left being loaded from the original server.


  Converted from IOK rule - original focuses on website analysis.'
