attack_types:
- Credential Phishing
description: 'ipapi is a GeoIP service allowing you to get the country code and other
  information from an IP address. It''s regularly used by phishing kits which want
  to hide themselves to analysts outside the country they''re targeting.


  This is a very naive approach (often the entire phishing site is loaded but then
  immediately redirected away from), but is often enough to evade basic sandboxes.


  Converted from IOK rule - original focuses on website analysis.'
detection_methods:
