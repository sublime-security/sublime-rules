title: Facebook Phishing Kit 7c475854
description: |
    This kit imitates the Facebook help center page
    and asks the user to enter their page name, email 
    address, phone number & full name in order to 'unblock' 
    their removed facebook page. 
    
    After filling out the form the user is prompted 
    with a dialog box where they must enter their 
    Facebook password for their 'security'.
