title: Discord Phishing Kit 664a17b

description: |
  Discord phishing kit that uses a external application invite as a lure, 
  as well as the real DiscordServer discord bot logo to make it seem legitmate.
  Once the user clicks the button labelled authorize it will open a pop-up window 
  mimicking the Discord login page pretty poorly. This rule uses the fact that 
  the same CSS file name is used across all domains that use this kit.
