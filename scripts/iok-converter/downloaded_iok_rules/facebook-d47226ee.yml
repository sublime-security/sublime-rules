description: |
    Facebook (Meta for Business) phishing kit 
    that communicates with a master server/API
    in order to exfiltrate credentials entered.

    This kit has several anti analysis capabilities, 
    such as being able to redirect to a non-existent 
    domain if the organization owning the IP address 
    of the viewer is part of a pre-defined list, which
    is defined in the javascript code.
