title: Save Page WE website saver
description: |
  Save Page WE is a chrome extension used by phishers to clone a target website and save it as a single HTML file.
  
  Unlike HTTrack (another commonly used tool):
  * It's a browser extension so doesn't require any additional tools to be installed.
  * It saves pages as a single HTML file (with all assets embedded in it) which makes the resulting kit more portable and easier to deploy.
