title: Hyphisher Phishing Kit e393965e
description: |
  `Hyphisher` is a phishing kit that focuses on targeting 
  Hypixel & LunarClient users using various lures such 
  as free ranks, cosmetics or modifications. 
  
  It works by socially engineering victims into thinking they 
  have been gifted an item from the attacker/compromised account, 
  it then asks the victim to enter their username and email, upon 
  doing this the backend will send the victim an email asking to 
  verify the gift by entering their authentication code into the 
  website.
  
  This specific kit dubbed `Hyphisher` is developed by a threat
  actor named `GuteNacht` and has since been modified and forked
  by other threat actors within the threat landscape.
