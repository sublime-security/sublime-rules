title: PostalFurious Phishing Kit f25f698b
description: |
    This phishing kit has been observed to target 
    various postal services & government-related 
    websites such as tolls, as well as mobile phone
    companies like Vodafone.

    Based upon these observations through scanning URLScan
    filtered results, this kit appears to be operated by a 
    Chinese-speaking phishing gang codenamed `PostalFurious`
    (coined by GROUP-IB).
