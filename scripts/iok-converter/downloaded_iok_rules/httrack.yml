title: HTTrack Website Copier
description: |
  HTTrack is an open source tool to save a website and all its dependencies to disk.
  It's used by phishers to quickly clone a target website to get a pixel-perfect clone they can adapt into a phishing kit.
  
  It's particularly liked by phishers because it tries to ensure that *all* resources are saved offline, and none are left being loaded from the original server.
