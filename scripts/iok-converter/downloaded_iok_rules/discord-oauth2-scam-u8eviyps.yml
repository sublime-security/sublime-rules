title: Discord oAuth2 Scam u8eviyps
description: |
    Detects a Discord oAuth2 scam confirmation page, which is often used in combination with social engineering to get the user to authorize for a spam application.
    This for example enables the attacker to add the victims into further scam/advertised servers using the `guilds.join` scope.
