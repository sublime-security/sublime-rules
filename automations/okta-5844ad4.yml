description: "Okta is a Single Sign-On (SSO) provider used by many enterprises and\
  \ this phishing kit targets those enterprises.\nIt aims to steal the victim's email\
  \ address, SSO password, and MFA details.\n\nTo decrease victim's suspicion this\
  \ kit (like many) includes details specific to the targeted company e.g. their name\
  \ and logo.\nHowever, unlike similar kits, this is hardcoded per instance of the\
  \ phishing site and isn't dynamic based on the victim's email.\n\n![Screenshot of\
  \ one of these camouflaged Okta phishing kits (in this case, actually targeting\
  \ Okta's own employees). [Via urlscan.io](https://urlscan.io/result/63fc7edd-116c-4128-a934-8ad6c9ad76e2/)](/static/63fc7edd-116c-4128-a934-8ad6c9ad76e2-BIDTSTDO.png)\n\
  \nThe same frontend code (HTML, CSS, and JS) is deployed regardless of the company\
  \ being targeted, but the company name and logo is provided by the C2 server.\n\n\
  ### Capabilities\n\nFrom analysing the code it appears this kit is set up to:\n\
  * Steal email address and password\n* Capture MFA codes\n* Push the download of\
  \ a (trojanized?) remote desktop tool `AnyDesk.exe`\n\n### Timeline\n\nSo far, the\
  \ earliest observed appearance of this campaign was on July 1st ([urlscan.io](https://urlscan.io/result/4125359d-3fea-4161-b0a9-bed1e3c04e16)).\n\
  This is a slightly earlier version of the phishing kit (referencing slightly different\
  \ JS files) and was last seen on July 13th.\n\nThe more recent version of the kit\
  \ (using the JS filenames referenced in this rule) was first observed on [July 17th](https://urlscan.io/result/0c7aba52-edf4-4280-9bc5-783fb8c93d87/).\n\
  \n### Attack Infrastructure\nUnlike many less sophisticated kits, this isn't deployed\
  \ on a PHP hosting provider but is instead deployed on virtual machines (usually\
  \ provided by Digital Ocean or Vultr).\n* Frontend assets (HTML/JS/CSS) are loaded\
  \ from the domain itself\n* The config (for example, which logo to display) is loaded\
  \ from a separate, non-HTTPS endpoint hosted on port 8080 on the same server\n\n\
  ```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph C2[Attack Infrastructure]\n    Domain[Lookalike\
  \ Domain] --> IP[Server IP]\n    end\n    Browser[Victim's Browser] -->|Load frontend:\
  \ GET https://domain| Domain\n    Browser -->|Fetch name and logo: GET http://ip:8080/api/app/settings|\
  \ IP\n```\n\nMost infrastructure is unique to each attack but there's occasionally\
  \ some crossover:\n* [45[.]63[.]39[.]151](https://urlscan.io/ip/45.63.39.151) has\
  \ been seen targeting multiple companies.\n* [mailchimp-help[.]com](https://urlscan.io/domain/mailchimp-help.com)\
  \ has been observed targeting multiple companies.\n\nConverted from IOK rule - original\
  \ focuses on website analysis."
