name: "VIP / Executive local or spoof impersonation from unsolicited sender"
description: "This rule identifies potential impersonation attempts involving the local part of an $org_vip email address. Specifically, it checks for cases where the local part of an $org_vip email (e.g., local_part@domain.com) appears with a different domain (e.g., local_part@foreigndomain.com). Additionally, the rule flags emails that match an $org_vip address exactly but fail authentication."
