name: "X (Twitter) impersonation with credential phishing motives"
description: |
  This rule is designed to identify impersonation attempts by analyzing the display name or sender's
  local part for the solitary use of "X" provided the email doesn't originate from twitter.com or x.com.
  Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is used to check for credential theft requiring a medium-to-high confidence level for flagging.
