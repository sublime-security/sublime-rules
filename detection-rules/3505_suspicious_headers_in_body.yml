name: "Suspicious: Email headers embedded in message body"
description: "Detects email headers embedded in the message body content, indicating forwarded phishing attempts, MIME boundary manipulation, delivery notification spoofing, or copy-paste phishing. This pattern is commonly seen when attackers forward legitimate emails and the headers get included in the body, or when spoofing system notifications."
