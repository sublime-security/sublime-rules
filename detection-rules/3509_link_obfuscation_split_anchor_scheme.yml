name: "Link: URL scheme obfuscation via split HTML anchors"
description: |
  Detects URLs intentionally split across multiple adjacent HTML anchor tags to evade URL analysis and detection systems.
  This sophisticated evasion technique breaks the URL scheme (http/https) across separate anchor elements,
  rendering as: <a>h</a><a>ttp://malicious.com</a>

  The technique bypasses many security tools that expect complete, well-formed URLs while displaying a
  seemingly normal link to end users. This pattern is strongly associated with credential phishing and
  compromised email accounts.
