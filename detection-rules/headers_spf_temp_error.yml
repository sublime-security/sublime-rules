name: "SPF temp error"
description: |
  Attackers can spoof domains that have no MX/SPF records, resulting
  in a DNS timeout. In O365 this fails closed (goes to spam), but in 
  Gmail this fails open (lands in the inbox) and shows a red padlock
  Reproduce on Ubuntu 18.04: 
  echo "test" | mail -s "Test" user@gmail.com -a"From: Support <support@nomxdomain.com>"
  Example headers:
  Received-SPF: temperror (google.com: error in processing during lookup of support@ltbit.com: DNS error) client-ip=<>;
  Authentication-Results: mx.google.com; spf=temperror
    (google.com: error in processing during lookup of support@nomxdomain.com: DNS error) smtp.mailfrom=support@nomxdomain.com
type: "rule"
severity: "medium"
