name: "Newly Registered Sender or Reply-To Domain with Newly Registered Linked Domain"
description: "This rule detects inbound emails that contain links and a reply-to address, where either the sender domain or the reply-to domain is newly registered (≤30 days old), and at least one linked domain is also very new (≤14 days old). It flags potential phishing or business email compromise attempts that use recently created infrastructure and reply-to mismatch tactics to bypass trust and impersonate legitimate contacts."
