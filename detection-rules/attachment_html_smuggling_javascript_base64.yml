name: "Attachment: HTML smuggling with base64 encoded JavaScript function"
description: |
  This rule identifies attachments that either have an HTML extension, lack any file extension, or possess an unrecognized file type
  and are employing Base64 encoding to conceal JavaScript functions within HTML script tags with little to no other content. 
  Such obfuscation tactics have been frequently observed in credential phishing campaigns.
