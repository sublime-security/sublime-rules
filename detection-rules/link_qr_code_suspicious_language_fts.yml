name: "Link: QR Code with suspicious language (first-time sender) "
description: |
  This rule analyzes image attachments for QR Codes that contain URLs including the recipient's email address. It ensures that the URLs do not link to any organizational domains.
  Additionally, it examines the email body using Natural Language Processing to detect credential phishing language.In cases of null bodies,
  the rule is conditioned to check the image for any suspicious terms.
