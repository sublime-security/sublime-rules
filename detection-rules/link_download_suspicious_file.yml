name: "Link to auto-download of a suspicious file type (unsolicited)"
description: |
  A link in the body of the email downloads a suspicious file type (or embedded file) such as an LNK, JS, or VBA.

  Recursively explodes auto-downloaded files within archives to detect these file types.

  This technique has been used by known threat actors in the wild.
