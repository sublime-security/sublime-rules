description: "This attacker group engages in fraud by registering domains via Namecheap. They mimic well-known brands with lookalike domains, often adding terms like LLC, LTD, Inc, or Corp. Their pattern includes fraudulent quote requests sent from namecheaps privat email service, followed by attempts to purchase goods on credit. These goods are routed through freight forwarders, typically destined for Western Africa. With increased scrutiny on cash payments to high-risk countries, they have shifted focus to goods. It is crucial to thoroughly validate any messages flagged by this rule, as well as the credit information, before releasing products to these entities."
