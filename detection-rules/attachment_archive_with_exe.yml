name: "Attachment: Archive with embedded EXE file"
description: |
  Recursively scans files and archives to detect embedded EXE files (with an MZ header).

  According to The Record, on June 7, 2021, the Ukrainian Secret Service attributed an 
  attack that used this technique to the "special services of the Russian Federation".

  The spear-phishing operation urged recipients to download a RAR archive included in the 
  email, which, when decompressed, would drop an EXE file with a double extension (filename.pdf.exe)
  that tried to pass as a PDF file.
