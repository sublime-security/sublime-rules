name: "Google Drive direct download link from unsolicited sender"
description: |
  This rule detects Google Drive links that use the direct download URL pattern which automatically downloads files when clicked. This pattern is frequently used by threat actors to distribute malware.
  
  The links are formatted like: drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download
  
  These links skip the preview page and immediately download the file to the user's device, which can be dangerous for recipients. Threat actors exploit this pattern to directly distribute malware while appearing to share legitimate content from a trusted service.
