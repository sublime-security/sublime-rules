description: "Detects messages containing credential theft language combined with social engineering topics like secure messages, notifications, or authentication alerts. The rule specifically identifies emails that deceptively claim to be from a 'safe sender' or contain 'safe content' in the first line, which is a common tactic used to bypass security filters and gain user trust."
