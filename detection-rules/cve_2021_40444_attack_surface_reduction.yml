name: "CVE-2021-40444 attack surface reduction: Exploitable file type from first-time sender"
description: |
    On September 7, 2021, Microsoft released details about a zero day RCE vulnerability in MSHTML that affects Microsoft Windows.

    According to Microsoft: "we are aware of targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability by using specially-crafted Microsoft Office documents. An attacker could craft a malicious ActiveX control to be used by a Microsoft Office document that hosts the browser rendering engine."

    At time of writing, there is no patch for CVE-2021-40444.

    This rule reduces attack surface by detecting vulnerable file types from first-time senders.
    
    When native attachment analysis is supported by the Platform, including OLE object dumping and binary explosion, this rule can be expanded to look for active signs of exploitation from within documents.
