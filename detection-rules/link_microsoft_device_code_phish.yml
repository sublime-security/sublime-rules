name: "Microsoft device code phishing"
description: |
  An attacker may generate a user code and send it to a target mailbox. With an appropriate lure, the targeted user may action the device code login and provide an attacker with the means to take over their account.

  This rule looks for the presence of the Microsoft device login portal link, as well as mentions of 'device code' or a 9 character alphanumeric device code value.
