name: "Attachment: DocX embedded binary"
description: "This rule is designed to detect sophisticated phishing attacks that deliver binary payloads through MS office open XML files. It identifies malicious documents containing embedded scripts or objects, either encoded in base64 or using specific JavaScript functions like createObjectURL or msSaveOrOpenBlob, which are indicative of attempts to download and execute a binary payload."
