name: Open redirect URL regex
description: |
  Microsoft threat intel describes a phishing campaign that uses DGA domains,
  free email services, and compromised email accounts to send massive numbers of phishing emails.
  These emails use open redirector URLs that begin with a distinct pattern:
    hxxps://t[.]domain[.]tld/r/?
  This rule can be improved to look for DGA senders, free email providers, brand
  impersonation content in the body, etc.
