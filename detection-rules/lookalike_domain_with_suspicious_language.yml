name: "Suspected lookalike domain with suspicious language"
description: "This rule identifies messages where links use typosquatting or lookalike domains similar to the sender domain, with at least one domain being either unregistered or recently registered (≤90 days). The messages must also contain indicators of business email compromise (BEC), credential theft, or abusive language patterns like financial terms or polite phrasing such as kindly. This layered approach targets phishing attempts combining domain deception with manipulative content"
