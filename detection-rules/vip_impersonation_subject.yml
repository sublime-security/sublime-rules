name: "VIP / Executive impersonation in subject (untrusted)"
description: |
  Sender subject contains the display name of a user in the $org_vips list, and the sender has never been seen before.
  
  The $org_vips list must first be manually connected to a VIP group of your upstream provider (Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 only) in order for this rule to work.
  Once connected, the list will be automatically synced and kept up-to-date. For more information, see the $org_vips documentation: https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/configure-org_vips-list
  
  This rule is recommended to be used on a relatively small list of VIPs, and is meant to reduce attack surface by detecting *any* message that matches the protected list of display names from a first-time or unsolicited sender.
  
  Additional rule logic can be added to look for suspicious subjects, suspicious links, etc.
