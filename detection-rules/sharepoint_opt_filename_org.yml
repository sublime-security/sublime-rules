name: "SharePoint OTP for filename matching org name"
description: "Detects Microsoft One-Time Passcode (OTP) messages where the shared document’s filename matches the sending organization's name. This typically indicates the recipient has verified their email address and is about to access a SharePoint file. Matching the document name to the sender's org is a pattern observed in multi-stage credential phishing campaigns, where attackers use branded file names to increase credibility and lure users into interacting with malicious content."
