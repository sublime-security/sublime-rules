name: "Reconnaissance: Large unknown recipient list"
description: |
  Recon messages, a form of deliverability testing, are used to validate whether a recipient address is valid or not, potentially preceding an attack.

  There's a large number of recipients that are unknown to the organization, no links or attachments, and a short body and subject from an unknown sender.
